                            In a team of 2, we developed an Android Application called Battle Buddies. 
                            Our goal was to create a phone application that assists in the safety of college-aged people who inevitably go to parties,
                            clubs, or bars. We wanted to encourage people to go out in groups (we call these people “Battle Buddies”)
                            and provide them with simple tools for ensuring the safety of one another, while still encouraging our users to enjoy themselves.

                            This project was developed along with another student for a Software Development course. 
                            The goal was to develop an Android mobile application to track and monitor risk regarding the COVID-19 virus.
                            Users are able to: log symptoms related to COVID, log any medicines currently being taken, 
                            log doctor visits, log travel, log news from friends and family regarding COVID diagnoses, and
                            Log restaurant visits Finally, users could access a dashboard indicating the likelihood that they were exposed to COVID
                            given all the information she has collected about her lifestyle. 
                            The calculation was based on an arbitrary formula and not based on science.

                            This was a project developed in a small team for a Software Development course. 
                            The goal was to develop a desktop application for searching Git projects using both single-keyword search and multiple-filtering. 
                            Additionally, capabilities were developed to display the projects on a web UI and, if desired, to show the file structure and dependencies of individual projects.
                            Keyword search was acomplished through API calls. Categorization and Filtering were acheived with the help of an OWL/XML ontology that I personally built.

                        <h3>Student Research: Convolutional Neural Network for Action Classification</h3>
                        <p class="project-summary">
                            As part of a small team, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the purpose of video classification.
                            We trained the model on the UCF-101 dataset which features 101 categories of different actions and 13,320 video clips collected from YouTube.
                            We were pleased with the results of the CNN we designed. The model architecture went through many different iterations, with varying amounts of hidden layers 
                            and several rounds of hyper-parameter optimization before we settled on our final model. The training accuracy was 99.8% and validation accuracy
                            was 69.5% at the final epoch. While the training accuracy suggests there could be overfitting, the validation accuracy is high enough 
                            that we were satisfied with the model’s ability to learn and predict. Our model proved to be as effective, if not more effective, 
                            than contemporary models on the same dataset.
