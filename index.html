                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My goal is to use my skills to create software that positively impacts people's lives. I am
                    passionate about working collaboratively in a team environment to develop innovative
                    solutions to complex problems. My long-term objective is to start my own business, where
                    I can focus on developing software that is valuable to society and aligns with my interests
                    in international relations, music, and sports. I believe that continued learning is essential,
                    and I am committed to seeking out professional and educational opportunities both inside
                    and outside of the US. Having just earned a Master's degree in Computer Science,
                    specializing in software development, I am ready to apply my skills and knowledge to make
                    a meaningful contribution to the tech industry. What I lack in experience, I more than make
                    up for in my strong work ethic and willingness to learn. I am proficient in programming
                    languages such as Java and Python and have worked on projects that required problemsolving
                    skills and attention to detail. I am excited to begin my career and contribute to the
                    development of innovative software solutions.</p>
